# Project-Investigate-a-Dataset
In this project, I will analyze the "No-show appointments" dataset and then communicate my findings about it. I will use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make my analysis easier.

All sources are included in the jupyter notebook, the original source of data on Kaggle, the dataset file, and explanation off each column.
